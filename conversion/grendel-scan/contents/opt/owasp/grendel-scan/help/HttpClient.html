    Enabling this feature causes all HTTP requests to be forwarded through the specified proxy server. Authentication
    is not currently supported, but will be in future releases.
    <H4><a name="Proxy address">Proxy address</a></H4>    
    The IP address or hostname of the upstream proxy.
    <H4><a name="Proxy port">Proxy port</a></H4>
    The upstream proxy's port.
    
    <H3><a name="HTTP Client Limits">HTTP Client Limits</a></H3>
    Limits on the HTTP requests. The grayed out boxes will be supported in future releases.
    <H4><a name="Max requests per second">Max requests per second</a></H4>
    The maximum number of HTTP requests that can be sent per second. This is useful for throttling throughput to servers.
    The default value is very safe, but is not very fast. If server load is not a major concern, increase this value.
    <h4><a name="Max connections per server">Max connections per server</a></h4>
    The HTTP standard states that a client should only create two simultaneous connections to a single host. Increasing 
    this can significantly improve scan performance if server load is not a major concern.
    <h4><a name="Max total connections">Max total connections</a></h4>
    The maximum number of connections to all hosts.
    <h4><a name="Max total requests">Max total requests</a></h4>
    The scan will terminate once this number of requests has been sent. A report will be generated based on the
    existing data. A value of zero indicates no limit. 
    <h4><a name="Max failed requests per host">Max failed requests per host</a></h4>
    The scan will terminate if this number of requests fail to any host within the scan scope. This refers to network
    failures, where a connections cannot be established, or is terminated before a response is sent. Note that an 
    Intrusion Prevention System may cut off attack requests. If this value is set to low, it may cause the scan to
    abort prematurely. A value of zero indicates no limit.
    
    <h3><a name="Miscellaneous Settings">Miscellaneous Settings</a></h3>
    <h4><a name="User agent string">User agent string</a></h4>
    The user agent string identifies the type of client to the web server. Some websites present content differently, 
    depending on the user agent. If the default user agent string doesn't work well, the default strings for recent 
    versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera are provided. A custom user agent string can
    also be provided.
    
    <h3><a name="Response Code Overrides">Response Code Overrides</a></h3>
    Many websites do not respond with proper "404" error codes for file-not-found conditions. Some sites may respond
    with a "200 OK", or with a "30x" redirect code. This presents many problems to an automated tool. In order to get 
    around these problems, response code overrides can be used to define a logical response code.
    <h4><a name="Use automatic response code overrides">Use automatic response code overrides</a></h4>
    Automatic response code overrides build a profile of what a file-not-found response looks like. Since a web server
    can respond differently, depending on the type of file requested, common dynamic file extensions are tested (aspx,
    php, cfm, etc). If you know that the website being tested will always respond with a true 404 message, disabling 
    this feature will slightly improve performance.
    <h4><a name="Test every directory">Test every directory</a></h4>
    Some web servers may have different responses, depending on what directory was requested. Enabling this feature will 
    cause the automatic response code override profile to be updated for each new directory discovered. If you know that
    the website responds the same across all directories, disabling this feature can improve performance, especially 
    on a website with many directories.
    <h4><a name="Manual response code overrides">Manual response code overrides</a></h4>
    If you are familiar with the website, a manual response code override can improve accuracy, without the small 
    performance hit from automatic overrides. The regular expression is evaluated against the response body. Any HTTP
    response code can be defined, but "404" is usually the only one required. It may be desirable to define error 
    pages as a "500" response code, if they are sent as a "200".
