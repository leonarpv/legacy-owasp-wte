<h2><a name="Authentication">Authentication</a></h2>

Currently, authentication credentials are&nbsp;defined as one or
more&nbsp;statically-entered username and password pairs.
&nbsp; Future
releases will also include support for domain fields and one-time
passwords (e.g. SecureID).
<h3><a name="Authentication Type">Authentication Type</a></h3>

Currently, only HTML Form-based authentication is supported. Future
releases
will support HTTP-based authentication (basic, digest, and NTLM).
<h3><a name="User Accounts">User Accounts</a></h3>

Multiple user accounts can be defined. This will be particularly useful
when the authorization enforcement testing module is released.
<h3><a name="HTML Form Authentication">HTML
Form-based
Authentication</a></h3>

HTML form-based authentication is the most common type for web
applications.
It is typically accompanied by a session tracking mechanism in a
cookie, or an HTTP query parameter.
<h4><a name="Wizard">Wizard</a></h4>

Settings for HTML form-based authentication can be automatically
detected
by submitting a request via the application's login form to the
form-based authentication wizard's internal
proxy server. Once started, this proxy server accepts a single HTTP
request which should contain the submission of sample credentials
(these need not be valid credentials -- the wizard is interested in
obtaining the HTTP method, URL, and parameter names normally submitted
by the form)
<h5><a name="Proxy bind address">Proxy bind address</a></h5>

This is the IP address that the proxy will bind to. To bind to all
available IP addresses, use "0.0.0.0". Generally, the default of
localhost (127.0.0.1) should be used.&nbsp;
<h5><a name="Proxy bind port">Proxy bind port</a></h5>

This is the port that the proxy will listen on. For some operating
systems, you will need to run with root privileges to bind to any port
&lt;= 1024.&nbsp;
<h5><a name="HTML Form-based Authentication Settings">HTML
Form-based Authentication Settings</a></h5>

These settings are automatically detected based on the login request
submitted by the client web browser.
<h4><a name="URL">URL</a></h4>

The URL that the login credentials will be sent to. This corresponds to
the "action" attribute of the HTML FORM tag. If there is no "action"
attribute, then it is the URL of the login page. Note that if the
submission method is GET, this URL should include the full query
generated by the form. If the method is POST, then it should match the
"action" attribute or login page URL identically.
<h4><a name="HTTP method">HTTP method</a></h4>

The HTTP method used to submit the query. It should match the "method"
attribute of the HTML FORM tag. If there is no "method" attribute, then
GET should be used.
<h4><a name="Username field">Username field</a></h4>

The name of the query parameter used to submit the username. This
should match the "name" attribute of the HTML INPUT tag used for the
username. This is not affected by the HTTP method being used. This is
required so that Grendel-Scan knows where to put the username being
tested.
<h4><a name="Password field">Password field</a></h4>

The name of the query parameter used to submit the password. This
should match the "name" attribute of the HTML INPUT tag used for the
password. This is not affected by the HTTP method being used. This is
required so that Grendel-Scan knows where to put the password being
tested.
<h4><a name="POST query">POST query</a></h4>

This is only used if the HTTP method is POST. This should be the
request body from an actual form submission, and should include the
username and password fields at a minimum. It is possible that other
fields could be present.
