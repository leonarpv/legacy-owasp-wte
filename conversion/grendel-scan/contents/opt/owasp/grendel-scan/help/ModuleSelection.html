    <h2>Test Module Selection</h2>
    This tab is pretty self-explanatory. There's no problem with enabling most of the modules, but some
    require special consideration. Each module has useful documentation, but some cautions are summarized below:<br /><br />
    <b>Spider:</b> The spider can cause problems for poorly designed websites. For example, if there is a link
    that reads, "Click here to delete the database", the spider will still follow the link. The HTTP standard
    states that requests that change data should only be sent over POSTs, but that is not always followed. 
    If that advice <i>is</i> followed by the website, then the "HTML tag requester" should be fine. The 
    "Form baseline" could easily cause problems though. The "URL-regex" module won't cause any problems over the
    tag requester, but is a little slow, and usually isn't needed.<br /><br />
    <b>File enumeration:</b> The directory enumerator, and especially the file enumerator can be very time 
    consuming. The backup file enumerator is faster, and can have more useful results.<br /><br />
    <b>Information leakage:</b> No problems.<br /><br />
    <b>Session management:</b> No problems.<br /><br />
    <b>XSS:</b> The exhaustive nature of the "XSS - Query" module can take a noticeable amount of time in a complicated
    application.<br /><br />
    <b>SQL Injection:</b> If a SQL tautology is tested against a query that does something dangerous (say deleting
    a record), then it could cause a problem if the query is vulnerable. This can be mitigated using URL blacklists
    and forbidden query parameters.<br /><br />
    <b>Nikto:</b> Just as safe as the real Nikto.<br /><br />
    <b>Miscellaneous attacks:</b> No problems<br /><br />
    <b>Application architecture:</b> Keep in mind that the mirroring module will require as much space as the
    website is large.<br /><br />
    <b>Web Server Configuration:</b> No problems<br /><br />
