    <h3><a name="Output Area">Output Area</a></h3>
    The output area attempts to demonstrate the progress of the scan. Future releases will allow for adjustable 
    verbosity settings.
    
    <h3><a name="Queue Sizes">Queue Sizes</a></h3>
    The number of jobs in each queue. The categorizer queue should always be zero, or near zero. If it isn't try 
    increasing the categorizer thread count. The requester queue is used primarily by the spider.
    
    <h3><a name="Pause Scan">Pause Scan</a></h3>
    This button will pause the scan. HTTP responses will be processed if the request was sent before the pause.
    
    <h3><a name="Close Proxy">Close Proxy</a></h3>
    Disables the internal proxy server. This is important because the scan will not complete while the proxy is
    open. Closing it signals that the user doesn't want to submit any more requests for testing.
    
    <h3><a name="Terminate Scan">Terminate Scan</a></h3>
    Immediately terminates the scan. A report will be generated and any findings already discovered will be included.

    <h3><a name="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></h3>
    <h4><a name="Scan appears hung">Scan appears hung</a></h4>
    If all of the queues are empty, make sure the proxy is closed. If it isn't, the scan is still waiting for more
    input.<br />
    <br />
    If there are still items in the queue, try pausing and unpausing the scan. Also try to connect directly to the targeted
    website. It's possible that the website is down or very, very slow.<br />
    <br />If it has been several minutes since new lines were added to the output
    area, the scan may be truly hung. 
    <h4><a name="Scan never stops">Scan never stops</a></h4>
    It's difficult to say how long a scan should take. For a large and complicated web application, with all 
    test modules enabled, several hours may not be unusual, especially with bandwidth throttling. <br />
    <br />
    One cause of a never ending scan is if the website may present a never ending stream of unique content. If the spider is 
    enabled, the scan will continue as long as new content is being discovered. The forbidden and irrelevant parameter
    lists can be used to prevent this condition.<br />
    <br />
    If file and directory enumeration is enabled, incorrect file-not-found responses may cause it to never 
    finish. Usually, enabling "automatic response code overrides" with the "test every directory" option will 
    fix this. It may be necessary to add a manual pattern.<br />
    <br />
    Eventually, you may need to terminate the scan.
    <h4><a name="Scan is very slow">Scan is very slow</a></h4>
    There are several things that can cause the scan to be slow. Look at your system resources. Is another process 
    using a lot of the CPU cycles? Is memory paging taking place? If not, check the targeted website's 
    responsiveness with a direct connection (not through Grendel-Scan's internal proxy). Also, keep in mind that 
    the bandwidth throttling is intended to slow the scan down. If server load isn't a concern, increasing the 
    limits can significantly improve scan speed.
