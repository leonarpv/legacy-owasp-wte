<h3><a name="Ignored Query Parameters">Ignored Query Parameters</a></h3>

    This is a list of HTTP query parameters that do not have a significant impact on application functionality. 
    For example, some applications may have a random number as part of every query. If this parameter wasn't ignored,
    then every request would appear unique, even if it had the same result in the application. <br />

    These parameters are ignored when determining the uniqueness of a URL, which is important for spidering. These
    parameters will still be tested for most vulnerabilities, such as XSS or SQL injection. They will be ignored
    for session ID testing.
    
    
<h3><a name="Forbidden Query Parameters">Forbidden Query Parameters</a></h3>

    These are HTTP query parameters that are not tested at all. This could be because they are sensitive and have
    the potential to damage the application environment, but it is more likely because they don't need to be 
    tested. For example, .Net's __VIEWSTATE parameter is already well tested. Further testing by Grendel-Scan is
    unlikely to reveal any vulnerabilities, but will slow down the scan, and perhaps cause problems with session 
    handling.
    
    
<h3><a name="Known Session ID Patterns">Known Session ID Patterns</a></h3>

    These regular expressions identify names used to store session identification tokens (these may be present in HTTP
    cookies or HTTP query parameters)
        
    
<h3><a name="URL Regular Expression Filters">URL Regular Expression Filters</a></h3>

    These regular expressions are applied against all HTTP requests before they are sent. If at least one whitelist 
    regular expression matches against the URL, and no blacklist expressions match, the request is sent. Adding a
    base URL will implicitly define a whitelist expression for that scheme, host, and port combination. The expressions
    can match against any part of the URL. To match the entire URL, use something like this: <br />

    <code>^http://www.grendel-scan.com/.*$</code><br />

    <br />

    You may want to remove some of the default filters, especially if you are using the internal proxy server.
    One of the default rules blocks media files, which are not needed for a fully automated scan. If you are 
    using the proxy, you also might want to add some whitelist filters for the domain that you are testing. For
    example, a site hosted on www.ffff.com, might host the images on images.ffff.com. If the base URL is only 
    for the main site, the images site will be blocked.
