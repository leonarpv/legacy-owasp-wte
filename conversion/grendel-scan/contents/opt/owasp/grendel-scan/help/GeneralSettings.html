    Grendel-Scan supports a internal proxy server that can be used to guide the scan through an application. This is 
    particularly useful for complicated applications, such as ones using AJAX or JSON. As you browse the application
    through this proxy server, Grendel-Scan will test the application components that you request. This is a safer
    alternative to the spider modules.
    <H4><a name="Proxy bind address">Proxy bind address</a></H4>    
    This is the IP address that the proxy will bind to. To bind to all available IP addresses, use "0.0.0.0". 
    Generally, the default of localhost (127.0.0.1) should be used.&nbsp;
    <H4><a name="Proxy bind port">Proxy bind port</a></H4>
    This is the port that the proxy will listen on. For some operating systems, you will need to run with root 
    privileges to bind to any port &lt;= 1024.&nbsp;
    <H4><a name="Max proxy threads">Max proxy threads</a></H4>
    These threads are only used for accepting and processing proxy requests. They are not used for any testing. Under 
    most circumstances, two threads should be plenty.
    
    <H3><a name="Thread Settings">Thread Settings</a></H3>
    <H4><a name="Max requester threads">Max requester threads</a></H4>
    The requester threads service the requester queue, which is primarily used for the spider. If you are not using 
    any of the spider modules, set this to "1", but never to "0".
    <H4><a name="Max tester threads">Max tester threads</a></H4>
    The tester threads service the testing queue, which is where most of the heavy lifting is done. Most HTTP requests
    initiated by testing modules are requested using these threads, not the requester threads (which are used for
    spidering). If the performance bottleneck does not appear to be the network, and you have CPU cycles to spare, 
    increasing the number of tester threads may improve performance. If the thread count is significantly above the 
    default, total memory available should also be increased. This can be done in the launch script.
    <H4><a name="Max categorizer threads">Max categorizer threads</a></H4>
    The categorizer threads service the categorizer queue. When an HTTP transaction is completed, it is sent to 
    the categorizer queue to determine which tests should be run against it. The default value should be sufficient,
    unless the categorizer queue is consistently above zero. 
    
    <h3><a name="Output Settings">Output Settings</a></h3>
    <h4><a name="Output directory">Output directory</a></h4>
    The output directory is the default location for any data saved to disk. This includes the report file, the HTTP
    transaction record, the error log, and output from modules (such as the website mirror).
    
    <H3><a name="Base URLs">Base URLs</a></H3>
    The base URLs are primarily used to seed the spider. It also adds an implicit URL white-list rule based on the 
    scheme, hostname, and port number of the provided URL.

    <h4><a name="Report type">Report type</a></h4>    
    Currently, only text and HTML formated reports are available. The text format still has some issues, so HTML is
    the best bet. PDF and XML formated reports are on the roadmap.
    <h4><a name="Filename">Filename</a></h4>
    The output filename for the report. Make sure that it's a valid filename, path, permissions, etc.
    <h4><a name="Minimum severity">Minimum severity</a></h4>
    The minimum severity of event to include in the report. Usually, "informational"
    is the best value.
