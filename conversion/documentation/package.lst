ratproxy 
- drew: gave an issue - "cat: 2: No such file"
- matt: ldd shows it can't find the ssl libraries. Since it was compiled on SLAX, should re-compile on Ubuntu. It wants libcrypto.so.0 and libssl.so.0 but Ubuntu only provides libcrypto.so.0.9.8 and libssl.so.0.9.8.  Could create a symlink but I'd prefer less of a kludge.  HOLD for recompile.
