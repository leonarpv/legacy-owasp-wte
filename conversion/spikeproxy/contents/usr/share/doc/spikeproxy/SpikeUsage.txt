			Spike Proxy Win32 Usage Guide:

Unzip the full package into C:\ this should create a folder called "spikeproxy". If you want to 
unzip it to another drive other than C:\ you will have to edit the runme.bat files within the
package. 

Start SpikeProxy by executing the runme.bat file in C:\spikeproxy\.

Check that the directory C:\SPIKEProxy\spkproxy\spikeProxyUI\ is empty. There's a cleanup.bat
for this but I prefer a manual check.

Now setup your browser to use this as a proxy. (host: 127.0.0.1 port 8080 for HTTP/HTTPS)

Now browse through your site you want to test putting things like asdf asdf into User/Password fields
and submitting them.

Once you have browsed the complete site or files you want to test point your browser to 
http://spike

This is the user interface where you can perform all the actions. 

Everything else is straight forward. If you have any questions feel free to e-mail me.
