    Character/String (Encoding)
	
	* URL UTF-8 (%XX)       - when feed with UTF-8 characters it may return unexpected results
		this is not a bug but the implication that JavaScript is based on Unicode and not UTF-8
		hence this action must be feed with real URL encoded UTF-8 characters
	* Unicode halfwidth     - lazy implementation does not check for undefined halfwidth characters
	* Block TEA (raw)       - most likely not reversible with corresponding decoding function
	* Block TEA (*)         - works for character code <256 only
	* x-bit binary          - works for character code <256 only
	* xHMAC                 - HMAC Key not yet implemented
	
    Character/String (Decoding)
	
	* base64                - is ambigious for 2-Byte characters (like '&#8364;') in all browsers
	* Block TEA (raw)       - most likely not reversible with corresponding encoding function
	* Punycode              - may return wrong decoded text if input string is IDN coded
	
    uuencode
	
	Following restrictions apply currently:
	
	* uuencode              - '`' used as padding character; all lines are 62 characters + leading byte count character 'M' + final '\n'
	* uuencode (hist)       - '&#160;' (space 0x20) used as padding character; last line of encoding may have different leading byte count character
	* uuencode (user)       - "Prefix" used as begin line, "Suffix" used as end line and
		"Delimiter" used as padding character. Note that '\n' must
		be part of the prefix and suffix string if needed.
	
    uudecode
	
	* uudecode (user)       - "Prefix" as begin line and "Suffix" as end line must both be terminated by '\n' character.
	
    IP Converter
	
	* IPv6                  - lazy implementation for converting from IPv6 ;-)
	
    RegEx
	
	* descriptive text for meta characters sometimes wrong
		workaround: reload page
	
	
	
KNOWN GUI PROBLEMS
	
	Starting with EnDe version 0.1.69 this section is obsolete.
	It will no longer be updated.

	help identify current ones.

	* nested window: [x] [?] - both buttons have wrong y position -->

				  has its own decission how to sort hashes

    IP
	
	* Conversion from/to "64-bit" integer does only work for values in the range 0 - 2^53 due to JavaScript limitations.
	* If option ". dot as delimiter" is unchecked some IP conversions will fail with result NaN. Input and output delimiter needs to be distingushed.
	* Conversion from returns NaN (partial) if there're not at least 4 octets in the computed IP. use "incomplete dotted IP" option to prefix or suffix missing octets.
	
    Timestamp
	
	* Probably wrong with some TZ settings, needs to be verified ...
		  -- some error messages in guess()
	
    RegEx
	
	* Conversion from [parsed] to [Text]
		fails if there are spaces, tabs or newlines right after a '('
		character. These characters are lost then. This is a known bug and
		no fix is planed.
