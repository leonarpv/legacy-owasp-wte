		    ****SQLiX Installation Notes*****

   SQLiX is a PERL-based program. It is dependent upon two PERL modules, which, in turn, have their own dependencies.
   The two PERL modules SQLiX is dependent upon are:

	1) WWW::CheckSite::Spider
	2) Tie::CharArray

   We, the contributors to the OWASP WTE (and the resulting LiveCD), have attempted to program into the installation, a script that will invoke PERL and install and build the dependent modules.
   In the event that this fails, we have included here manual installation notes.  Try running SQLiX under the Scanners submenu first and enter "sqlix --help" at the promt to check the install.  If that fails, then try the manual CPAN install steps below.  Its our hope you won't have to do more then close this editor.


   1) sudo perl -MCPAN e "shell"
   Once you come to a command line you can enter text into, as opposed to the initial setup of questions and answers PERL will ask.
   2) install Archive::Zip
   3) install Algorithm::Diff
   4) install Tie::CharArray

   The above modules should install cleanly, or at least, with minimum fuss. However, building WWW:CheckSite::Spider fails more than it succeeds, because of tests it runs on various systems. So, in order to install it without running the tests:
   5) force install WWW::CheckSite::Spider

Good Luck!
