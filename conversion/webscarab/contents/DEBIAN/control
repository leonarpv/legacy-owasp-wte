Description: WebScarab: a local proxy for web application testing
 WebScarab is a framework for analysing applications that communicate using the
 HTTP and HTTPS protocols. It is written in Java, and is thus portable to many
 platforms. WebScarab has several modes of operation, implemented by a number of
 plugins. In its most common usage, WebScarab operates as an intercepting proxy,
 allowing the operator to review and modify requests created by the browser
 before they are sent to the server, and to review and modify responses returned
 from the server before they are received by the browser. WebScarab is able to
 intercept both HTTP and HTTPS communication.  The operator can also review the
 conversations (requests and responses) that have passed through WebScarab.
