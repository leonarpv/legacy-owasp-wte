Pre-requisites:

Python 2.5/2.6 **
PyXML
Java 1.6.X

Tar and Gzip are used in concert to create the wsfuzzer* "gzipped archives". Hence the package has the .tar.gz extension. The install process is to simply:

1. extract the files from this tarball (archive)
2. alter the "JAVA_HOME" value in file "parseWsdl.sh" - this is the full path up to the java home (currently Java 1.6 is required)

So for example that value may look like this on a Mac:

JAVA_HOME="/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6.0/Home"


To extract the program one can obviously use the tar and gzip commands separately. But an easier way takes into account that tar's -z option feeds the archive to gzip after unpacking, Thus:

# tar -xvzf wsfuzzer*.tar.gz

extracts all files from the gzipped archive and places them into the current directory. For example:

cd /pentest
tar -xvzf wsfuzzer-1.9.4.tar.gz

extracts all files to /pentest/

Upon proper tarball extraction perform step 2 as listed above and the install is complete. You can move on to running the program.

Get the tarball from sourceforge: http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=155697


** Code has been updated to be compatible with the 2.6/3.X families of Python. If you are running something older like Python2.4 then you will have to install some libraries... 

Hashlib is one of those lib's that needs to get installed, find it here: http://code.krypto.org/python/hashlib/
