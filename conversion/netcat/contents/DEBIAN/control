Description: Netcat is a featured networking utility.
 It reads and writes data across network connections, using the TCP/IP protocol
 It is designed to be a reliable "back-end" tool that can be used directly or
 easily driven by other programs and scripts. At the same time, it is a feature-rich
 network debugging and exploration tool, since it can create almost any kind of
 connection you would need and has several interesting built-in capabilities.
